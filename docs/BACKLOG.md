# Backlog

> Milestones and work items; the dashboard reads this file. Seeded by `choose-path`, ticked off as part of every task's definition of done.

Format: one `## Milestone: <name>` heading per milestone (optional `(target: YYYY-MM-DD)`), then items:
`- [ ]` todo · `- [~]` in progress · `- [x]` done · `- [!]` blocked · `- [-]` dropped. Optional `(S|M|L)` size and `#tags`.
Roadmap tab: item order here is the proposed sequence (numbered 1..N across both lanes); an optional `> Sequence: <why>` line under a milestone heading explains it, and a `docs/specs/<slug>.md` link on an item shows its PRD status. Tag technical work `#foundation` (or `#arch`, `#infra`, `#runway`, `#debt`, `#quality`, `#ci`, `#security`, `#process`) to put it in the technical-foundation lane; everything else counts as user value.
